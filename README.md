# Why-Should-I-Use.....

We will figure out why we should use "for loop" instead of writing print() 100 times. Usages of lambda function instead of a regular function, "list comprehensions" rather than "for loop", different between using "map" and "filter" vs not using. 

Use case of generator, decorator. and a little bit of analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of these fancy things.
and so on......

it's going to be funny.
